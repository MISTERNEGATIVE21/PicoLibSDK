Beautiful Day

Sunlight kisses my face like a dream
The sky's alive it's a vivid scheme
The wind hums secrets through the trees
A whisper of wonders carried by the breeze

Bitterness fades with the morning hue
Shadows retreat as the world renews
The pavement sparkles like it's brand new
It's a canvas painted with every view

It’s a beautiful day no battles to fight
Heart wide open soaking the light
No map no plans no rules to obey
Breathing in life on this glorious day

The flowers bloom like they’re here just to cheer
A melody's born every time I hear
Laughter ripple through the open air
Moments like these—rare beyond compare

Let the rain come it can’t dull my glow
Even thunder can’t steal my show
Through the storms we still find our way
Every hour is gold on this beautiful day

It’s a beautiful day no battles to fight
Heart wide open soaking the light
No map no plans no rules to obey
Breathing in life on this glorious day

It’s a beautiful day no battles to fight
Heart wide open soaking the light
No map no plans no rules to obey
Breathing in life on this glorious day
